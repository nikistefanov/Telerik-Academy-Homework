<div>Problem 5. Selection sort

Sorting an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order.
Write a script to sort an array.
Use the selection sort algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.
Hint: Use a second array</div>
