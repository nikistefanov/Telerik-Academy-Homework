## Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity Homework

#### Problem 1. **What is the expected running time of the following C# code?**
  - Explain why using Markdown.
  - Assume the array's size is `n`.

  ```cs
  long Compute(int[] arr)
  {
      long count = 0;
      for (int i=0; i<arr.Length; i++)
      {
          int start = 0, end = arr.Length-1;
          while (start < end)
              if (arr[start] < arr[end])
                  { start++; count++; }
              else 
                  end--;
      }
      return count;
  }
  ```
  
*Answer:*
**Algorithm complexity is O(n^2)**
Each iteration of the outer loop causes n more iterations of the inner loop

#### Problem 2. **What is the expected running time of the following C# code?**
  - Explain why using Markdown.
  - Assume the input matrix has size of `n * m`.

  ```cs
  long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
  {
      long count = 0;
      for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++)
          if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
              for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++)
                  if (matrix[row,col] > 0)
                      count++;
      return count;
  }
  ```
  
*Answer:*
**Algorithm complexity is O(n * m)**
